## What is the purpose of "Chem Archive"?
There are numerous deep learning models for chemistry, and reproducing them can be difficult due to differences in computing resources used or undisclosed magic hyperparameters. The first goal is to fairly compare them by reproducing under the same settings, the second is to manage various models and datasets in one place, and lastly, it's just for fun!
