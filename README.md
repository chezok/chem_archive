# Chem Archive
## What is the purpose of "Chem Archive"?
There are numerous deep learning models applied to chemistry, but reproducing them can be challenging due to differences in computing resources or the use of undocumented “magic” hyperparameters. The first goal of this project is to enable fair comparisons by reproducing models under consistent settings. The second is to organize various models and datasets in a centralized framework. And lastly—it's simply for fun!
